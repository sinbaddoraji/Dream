# Dream Maker - Unimplemented and Partially Implemented Features

This document provides a comprehensive overview of functionality that is currently unimplemented or only partially implemented in the Dream Maker application. Dream Maker is a canvas-based design tool built with React, TypeScript, and Konva.js.

## Executive Summary

Dream Maker is a promising design application with a solid foundation, but many features are currently implemented as placeholder functions that only log to console. The application has the UI structure in place but lacks the core functionality implementation.

## Critical Core Features (High Priority)

### Edit Operations
- **Undo/Redo System**: Menu items exist but only log to console
  - File: `src/components/MenuBar.tsx` lines 112-113
  - Implementation needed: Connect to history store and actual state reversal
  - Current: `console.log('Undo')` and `console.log('Redo')`

- **Copy/Cut/Paste Operations**: Menu items exist but not functional
  - File: `src/components/MenuBar.tsx` lines 115-117
  - Implementation needed: Clipboard management for canvas objects
  - Current: Only console.log statements

- **Delete Functionality**: Menu item exists but not connected
  - File: `src/components/MenuBar.tsx` line 118
  - Implementation needed: Remove selected objects from canvas
  - Current: `console.log('Delete')`

- **Select All**: Menu option exists but not implemented
  - File: `src/components/MenuBar.tsx` line 120
  - Implementation needed: Select all objects on canvas
  - Current: `console.log('Select All')`

### Canvas View Controls
- **Grid System**: Menu option available but not implemented
  - File: `src/components/MenuBar.tsx` line 130
  - Implementation needed: Overlay grid on canvas
  - Current: `console.log('Show Grid')`

- **Rulers**: Menu option exists but not functional
  - File: `src/components/MenuBar.tsx` line 131
  - Implementation needed: Add rulers to canvas edges
  - Current: `console.log('Show Rulers')`

- **Fullscreen Mode**: Menu option exists but not implemented
  - File: `src/components/MenuBar.tsx` line 142
  - Implementation needed: Browser fullscreen API integration
  - Current: `console.log('Fullscreen')`

### Documentation and Help
- **Documentation System**: Help menu exists but links nowhere
  - File: `src/components/MenuBar.tsx` line 148
  - Implementation needed: Documentation viewer or external links
  - Current: `console.log('Documentation')`

- **Keyboard Shortcuts Help**: Menu item exists but not functional
  - File: `src/components/MenuBar.tsx` line 149
  - Implementation needed: Modal showing all keyboard shortcuts
  - Current: `console.log('Keyboard Shortcuts')`

- **About Dialog**: Menu item exists but not implemented
  - File: `src/components/MenuBar.tsx` line 151
  - Implementation needed: About dialog with version info
  - Current: `console.log('About')`

## Partially Implemented Features (Medium Priority)

### Drawing Tools
- **Shapes Tool**: UI exists but limited shape creation
  - File: `src/components/Toolbar/DockableToolbar.tsx`
  - Status: Shape selector UI complete, but drawing implementation incomplete
  - Missing: Proper shape creation on canvas click/drag

- **Properties Panel**: Backup file indicates incomplete implementation
  - File: `src/components/Panels/PropertiesPanel.tsx.bak`
  - Status: Panel exists but not integrated into main UI
  - Missing: Property editing for selected objects

### Export Functionality
- **SVG Export**: Basic structure exists but incomplete
  - File: `src/services/FileService.ts` line 183
  - Status: Placeholder SVG generation
  - Missing: Proper Konva-to-SVG conversion logic

### Canvas State Management
- **Command History**: Backup file indicates rework in progress
  - File: `src/hooks/useCommandHistory.ts.bak`
  - Status: History tracking exists but may need refactoring
  - Missing: Proper command pattern implementation

## Backup Files Indicating Incomplete Work

The following backup files suggest features that were started but not completed:

1. **`src/hooks/useCommandHistory.ts.bak`**: Command pattern for undo/redo
2. **`src/components/Canvas/Canvas.old.tsx.bak`**: Previous canvas implementation
3. **`src/components/Canvas/SelectionOverlay.tsx.bak`**: Selection visualization
4. **`src/components/Panels/PropertiesPanel.tsx.bak`**: Object properties editor

## Infrastructure Improvements Needed (Low Priority)

### Build System
- **TypeScript Configuration**: Build currently fails with 807 TypeScript errors
  - Issue: Missing type declarations and React configuration
  - Impact: Development workflow and production builds

### Error Handling
- **Toast Notifications**: Error handling exists but uses console.error
  - File: `src/components/MenuBar.tsx` lines 52, 60, 78
  - Implementation needed: User-friendly error messaging system

### Performance
- **Auto-save Optimization**: Currently saves every 5 seconds
  - File: `src/services/PersistenceService.ts`
  - Implementation needed: Debounced saving based on user actions

## Feature Areas by Implementation Status

### ✅ Fully Implemented
- Basic canvas with Konva.js integration
- Tool selection UI (toolbar)
- Theme switching (Light/Dark/High Contrast)
- File save/load operations
- Image import functionality
- Basic zoom controls
- Auto-save to localStorage
- Sidebar toggles

### ⚠️ Partially Implemented
- Shape drawing (UI complete, logic incomplete)
- Export functionality (PNG/JPG work, SVG placeholder)
- Object selection (basic selection works)
- History panel (UI exists, history tracking limited)

### ❌ Not Implemented
- Undo/Redo operations
- Copy/Cut/Paste operations
- Grid and rulers
- Fullscreen mode
- Properties panel integration
- Help system and documentation
- Advanced drawing tools (pen, brush details)
- Object grouping/ungrouping
- Text editing capabilities
- Advanced selection tools

## Recommended Implementation Priority

### Phase 1 (Core Functionality)
1. Implement undo/redo system
2. Complete copy/cut/paste operations
3. Fix delete functionality
4. Complete shape drawing implementation

### Phase 2 (User Experience)
1. Integrate properties panel
2. Implement grid and rulers
3. Add help system and keyboard shortcuts dialog
4. Complete SVG export functionality

### Phase 3 (Polish)
1. Fix TypeScript build issues
2. Add toast notification system
3. Implement fullscreen mode
4. Optimize auto-save behavior

## Technical Notes

- The application architecture is well-structured with proper separation of concerns
- Zustand is used for state management
- The component structure supports the intended functionality
- Most UI components are complete and styled appropriately
- The main gap is in the business logic implementation rather than UI/UX design

## Conclusion

Dream Maker has a solid foundation with excellent UI/UX design and proper architectural patterns. The main development effort should focus on implementing the business logic for the core features that currently only have placeholder implementations. The codebase is well-organized and appears ready for these implementations.
